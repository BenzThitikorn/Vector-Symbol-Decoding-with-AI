# Vector-Symbol-Decoding-with-AI
The vector symbol decoding technique is a unique approach to solving burst errors in nonbinary code. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been utilized to enhance the success of error correction. Multilayer perceptron and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks will be considered for this purpose.
